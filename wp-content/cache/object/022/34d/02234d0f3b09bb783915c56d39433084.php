<em>Present at the signing ceremony held at AIM were (from left) Dr. Tahrini A. Garcia, chief finance officer of In1Go; Ramon S. Garcia, chief executive officer of In1Go; Dr. Christopher P. Monterola, executive director,&nbsp;ACCeSs@AiM&nbsp;and school head of AIM‚Äôs Aboitiz School of Innovation Technology and Entrepreneurship; and Dr. Erika Fille T. Legara, deputy director,&nbsp;ACCeSs@AiM&nbsp;and program director of AIM‚Äôs Master of Science in Data Science program.</em>
<p style="text-align: left;">The project aims to use information or real data to solve the company‚Äôs real-world business problems. Data from various industries are becoming more and more important for businesses to get ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In1Go Technologies, Inc., an information technology services and BPO (business process outsourcing) company that provides a wide range of value solutions using the latest technologies, provided data so students in AIM‚Äôs Master of Science in Data Science program could develop a model that could lead to solutions to its business problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking forward to this partnership because this is new in the industry. With data science becoming more important, we‚Äôre looking into gaining insights from the information that we have to leverage our clients‚Äô position,‚Äù said Ramon S. Garcia, chief executive officer of In1Go.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data In1Go shared from its clients could help develop a predictive model that the company could use internally for its projects or incorporate into its existing applications. In1Go‚Äôs clients are mostly from the fast-moving consumer good (FMCG) industry. Their data include inventories, sales, and on-shelf availability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Data Science students from AIM studied, analyzed and worked on the live data to create a model that could benefit In1Go‚Äôs clients. Students partnered with data scientists from&nbsp;ACCeSs@AiM&nbsp;to look for patterns and gain insights from the information provided to meet In1Go‚Äôs requirements and parameters to solve its business problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Students used computers, machine learning and algorithms to process the data. Depending on the business objective or problem, students tried developing solutions based on the information from the data. The collaborative project also served to meet thesis requirements of AIM‚Äôs Data Science students.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">‚ÄúWhat we envision is for our students to work closely with different industries and do a practical application of data science by working hand in hand with various organizations,‚Äù said Dr. Christopher P. Monterola, executive director at&nbsp;ACCeSs@AiM&nbsp;and head of AIM‚Äôs Aboitiz School of Innovation Technology and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Master of Science in Data Science program is a pioneering program of AIM‚Äôs Aboitiz School of Innovation Technology and Entrepreneurship, considered the first in the Philippines and one of the firsts in Asia.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In1Go specializes in the supply chain, field and distribution management, location marketing and location-based services using state-of-the-art technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Through this collaboration, In1Go hopes to use the information they have to service its clients more effectively. AIM, on the other hand, hopes to work with more industries and help them understand the advantages of using data science in today‚Äôs competitive business environment.&nbsp;</p>
