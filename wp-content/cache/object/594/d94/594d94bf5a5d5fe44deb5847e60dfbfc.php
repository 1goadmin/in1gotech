<p style="text-align: center;">Eye for luxury</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">International luxury group Kering Eyewear presented its latest collection from seven iconic brands at The Gallery of The Peninsula Manila recently.</p>
Bottega Veneta‚Äôs <em>intrecciato</em>&nbsp;(meticulous technique of weaving leather) is what the brand is famous for. The laser-etched&nbsp;<em>intrecciato</em>&nbsp;motif is seen in the acetate of the eyewear.
<p style="text-align: left;">Puma‚Äôs collection consists of ultra-modern shapes that enhance the freedom of movement while Alessandro Michele Gucci eyewear collection is hinged on gender neutrality and eccentric decorations.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Environmentally conscious Stella McCartney uses ethically sourced materials such as bio-acetate, fibers from seeds, and conifers and broadleaves making it 100-percent eco-friendly, 100-percent biodegradable, 100-percent recyclable. Iconic French designer Yves Saint Laurent‚Äôs eyewear can be described as timeless, unisex classics that are restyled with modernity. The late Alexander McQueen‚Äôs contemporary McQ brand‚Äôs new eyewear styles are inspired by vintage Americana.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">During the launch, Kering Eyewear representatives toured guests around the venue and spoke to them about the collection. They also gave recommendations on what eyewear would best suit one, based on the shape of one‚Äôs face.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A curated food selection by chef&nbsp;<strong>Eduardo Madela&nbsp;</strong>highlighted the signature look of each brand.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;(Kering Eyewear pieces will be available in leading department stores and optical shops in the Philippines soon.)</p>
