This is because marketing and sales go together like mac and cheese, and is the foundation that keeps companies strong and able to continue growing.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">While business evolves, it becomes nearly impossible to keep up with daily operations and still maintain value-driven, personalized relationships with each and every customer. This is when marketing directors get called in to build performance-driven programs that create the conversions business owners need for their company.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">However, having an efficient marketing director means that company\u2019s marketing program is once again too large to comfortably manage. Budget meetings get held. Expenses get cut. Valuable time and money are wasted on menial, repetitive tasks like email blasts and social media updates.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Fortunately, there\u2019s such a thing as marketing automation software, which plays a huge role in helping professionals grow their business.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">About Marketing Automation.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you pare it down to the basics, marketing automation is an offshoot of customer relationship management that uses software and web-based services as means of implementing, managing, automating, and even optimizing various tasks and processes that would have otherwise taken up valuable time. This includes things like email marketing, website integration, lead generation, customer profiling, form and page building, and A\/B testing.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Basically, it does all of the repetitive tasks that take time and money away from the budget for your marketing department, like email and social media marketing. All of those tasks are replaced by marketing automation software and its applications, which are both designed to optimize the performance of your business.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Marketing Automation Works.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">When you pare it down to the basics, marketing automation is an offshoot of customer relationship management that uses software and web-based services as means of implementing, managing, automating, and even optimizing various tasks and processes that would have otherwise taken up valuable time.

All of those tasks are replaced by marketing automation software and its applications, which are both designed to optimize the performance of your business.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Marketing Automation Works.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Marketing automation creates a web of connections between multiple marketing channels, such as content marketing, email marketing, and social media marketing. This makes sure your leads are generated, scored, and nurtured to better allow your team to focus their attention on other aspects of running your business.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With the help of marketing automation software, it becomes a million times easier to send targeted emails and other messages with personalization so you can build consumer-brand trust by ensuring your brand and the services and\/or products offered are directly relevant to the needs and interests of your target consumers.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This automation means your marketing department is then better able to focus on the quality of the campaigns being run, rather than the quantity of the campaigns. Additionally, the software collects data on your prospects\u2019 interests, demographics, purchasing behavior, and needs, to better nurture those leads and personalize any future offers being sent.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">The Benefits of Marketing Automation.<\/h5>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"23671db","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/dev.1go.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/marketing_automation_img_1.703x0-is.jpg\" \/><\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"0d1e73b","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The list of benefits that come from using marketing automation to optimize your business is a long one, but there are some benefits that really stand out and are the key to growing your business and getting new leads.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Saves Time and Money<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Through the use of marketing automation software, a single individual can send out a massive email blast of hundreds of messages and do the work of a large sales and\/or marketing department \u2013 all on their own.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Implement the software and your business will have automated marketing campaigns in a short amount of time. Your business will be able to send out hundreds \u2013 or even thousands \u2013 of personalized emails every single day, in addition to generating and nurturing leads while spending less time and money on doing so.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Increases Revenue.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Increased revenue comes with decreased time and expenses, and makes up the biggest benefit marketing automation has to offer. In fact, last year\u2019s report by Adestra revealed a staggering 74% of all survey respondents claimed their marketing automation software\u2019s ability to save them time was the biggest benefit, with customer engagement being a close second for 68% of all respondents.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With all of this time being freed up, 80% of businesses surveyed by VB last year found that using marketing automation has resulted in significant increase in leads. Considering the fact these are the very lifeblood of a business\u2019 sales, this is one benefit that shouldn\u2019t be taken lightly.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Even better, the same study found that these leads aren\u2019t just any type of leads either \u2013 they are generally quality leads that brought about an increase in conversions for 77% of businesses.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Consistent Branding is Easier.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There\u2019s no question about it: Consistent branding is essential.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With marketing automation software, it\u2019s a million times easier to create a consistent brand that spans across your multiple marketing channels.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Considering how much money and time you save with this, your marketing is better able to focus their efforts on expanding your audience to better reach your target demographic across emails, social media channels, mobile applications, direct mailers, and more. You can spend more money on perfecting your web design, landing pages, content marketing, and other aspects of building your brand and growing your business.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">By making your business more available to your customers, your visibility is gets the boost it needs to turn those website visitors and prospects into customers.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Versatile and User-Friendly.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Even with all of its uses and benefits, marketing automation is actually surprisingly easy to use. After all, the software is all about optimization and making it easier to grow your business. Because of that, even the employees that aren\u2019t so technically-gifted will be able to use it with little training.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most marketing automation software packages come with templates, editors, and helpful guides that walk you through the while process all the way from initial creation and design to final distribution.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It doesn\u2019t require your employees to know any coding, graphic design, or other technical skillsets. They can jump right in and get to work once it\u2019s implemented.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Lead Generation and Nurturing.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Having to spend time reaching out to each individual lead and nurturing that lead through an entire sales funnel takes time. It takes money.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">With marketing automation, you can reach out to a potential lead right away from the very first interaction, even if it\u2019s just a simple list subscription.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Let\u2019s say a website visitor spends time reading through your content and offered products\/services, and decides to sign up for your mailing list. Once you\u2019ve got that email added to your list, you can send out one of several types of automated solutions.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">They\u2019ll receive a welcome message and that confirmation notice (always a good idea), and then the prospect will be immediately guided through the sales funnel. You can use the automation to offer discounts and other offers that are directly relevant to your customer\u2019s needs, interests, and past purchase behavior. As the customer is guided through the sales funnel, the software collects even more data to fill out their customer profile, enabling you to better target your emails and other marketing campaigns.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Choosing Marketing Automation Software.<\/h5>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"fcde84a","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/dev.1go.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/marketing_automation_img_2.jpg\" \/><\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"3689136","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Just like with any other type of major software implementation, it\u2019s essential to go through a full assessment of your business before purchasing and implementing marketing automation software. Even with its numerous benefits, you may decide your business hasn\u2019t yet reached the point for it to need all those extra components for your marketing.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">You need to go over the needs of your business, such as your staffing capabilities and revenue goals, how much you can invest in new marketing software, and what your current employee skills and abilities are.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some things to consider are:<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The type of marketing automation software that would best fit your needs.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your sales and marketing goals.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The size of your staff \u2013 Do you have enough staff available to implement a marketing automation solution?.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">How you will measure the marketing automation software\u2019s success \u2013 What benchmarks do you have in place?.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your income and expenses \u2013 Do you have the financial resources required for this?.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">After taking these things into consideration, it\u2019s best to take some time to prepare your business for marketing automation before implementing the solution. Just like with anything else in the world, whether it\u2019s business-related or not, marketing automation software isn\u2019t perfect. This is why business owners need to take the time to understand both its benefits and limitations.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">While it automates most things, it doesn\u2019t automate everything. You will still need staff available to do hands-on marketing, including sending out messages and interacting with customers. While it optimizes and streamlines a good portion of you business\u2019 workflow, it doesn\u2019t replace a human employee.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">A big part of the confusion people have when they purchase marketing automation solutions from a vendor stems from the implementation and utilization being driven by someone who doesn\u2019t think about the fact they need involve the CRM, content, email, and\/or SEO teams.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">At one point or another, all of these different teams within your marketing department should be expected to handle this technology, so they should be informed of how it works. If they never get to learn about it, explore its different uses, or discuss it with the CMO or the vendors, conflict is bound to come up.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There should also be a discuss of who should be the one in charge of running the marketing platform once it\u2019s introduced and set in place. This person, as well as the rest of the team, should be able to test out the platform and speak to the vendors.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">To do this, find a vendor and schedule a demo for your team. Things to consider are:<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">How easy the marketing automation solution is to use. Does it take a lot of time to learn, or is it basic and straightforward?.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Your marketing needs, and whether or not the vendor is offering a solution that aligns with these needs and goals.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The key features \u2013 Will they make a significant difference, or do they simply amount to expensive upsells you could do without?.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">How difficult or easy it would be to implement the new software within your company. Will it integrate well, or will it be too hard to get everyone on the same page?.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The amount of time it will take to implement.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whether or not the vendor offers free trials \u2013 You should always test a new business tech before investing in it.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Picking a Vendor.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As you can see, marketing automation software can certainly yield a whole host of benefits that grow your business and streamline your marketing efforts..<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unfortunately, the software isn\u2019t exactly \u201cone size fits all.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">There are tons of marketing automation platforms available, and they vary widely depending on price, features, and complexity. This can make it a bit difficult to find one that will best meet your needs.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Once you\u2019ve taken an assessment of your business and prioritized your revenue and marketing goals, it\u2019s time to take the next step in selecting the right marketing automation platform.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Key Features.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Most of them offer the same basic features across the board, but it\u2019s the key components that set them apart.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Are you looking for comprehensive inbound marketing? You\u2019re going to need something that integrates your blogging, social media, and email tools.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you want your sales reps to have access to your team\u2019s marketing data? You\u2019re going to want a platform that has its own CRM or at least CRM integration capabilities.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Do you want to be able to create landing pages that convert? Then you\u2019re going to want one that has pre-made landing page templates that make it easy to design a page in the shortest amount of time possible. Those platforms that offer drag-and-drop processes, much like Sendlane offers, are the type you want to look for.<\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: center;\">Key Features.<\/h5><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Key features aren\u2019t the only thing marketing automation vendors vary in \u2013 price is also a huge factor. Some platforms are bundled packages that are all-inclusive, but others come with a basic package with extra add-ons available for purchase. Pricing also tends to be affected by the number of contacts you have, so you may want to get one that reflects your next benchmark goal rather than your current numbers. This way, you have more time between upgrades.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">It all depends on what your industry, budget, and marketing goals are. HubSpot is more expensive than Act-On, for example, but Act-On doesn\u2019t have a content management platform and essential sophisticated analytics. If you\u2019re focusing on content strategy, HubSpot would be the better choice.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The most reliable marketing automation companies make the purchasing, testing, implementation, and utilization process as easy and efficient as they possibly can. This solution should grow your business, not bring it down with complicated tech components and expensive add-ons that won\u2019t directly benefit you. You want to pick software that is best for your business, rather than one you were talked into buying.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">The following is a list of additional vendors that have proven to offer the solutions that best fit their customers, and make everything as easy as possible.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Snaptactix<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Sendlane<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Salesforce<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Marketo<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">SAS<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Oracle<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">InfusionSoft<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">IBM<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">That about sums up all the basics about marketing automation and picking a platform \u2013 well, at least for this article. As you can see, marketing automation truly is the key to giving your business a boost, regardless of industry or size. This should give you a fairly good idea as to what marketing automation software is and what you should be considering when selecting the best marketing automation platform for your needs.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>In1go Technologies Inc.<\/b>\u00a0provides a wide range of value solutions for MarketingAutomation, widely used in the FMCG \/ Pharma industries.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This article originally appeared on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cmscritic.com\/dont-panic-the-ultimate-guide-to-picking-a-marketing-automation-tool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.cmscritic.com<\/a><\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":true}],"isInner":true}],"isInner":false},{"id":"accca67","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":25,"_inline_size":15,"margin":{"unit":"px","top":"050","right":"0","bottom":"20","left":"0","isLinked":false},"padding":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"_inline_size_tablet":100,"background_background":"classic","background_position":"center center","background_repeat":"repeat","background_size":"contain","margin_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"padding_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"hide_tablet":"hidden-tablet","hide_mobile":"hidden-phone"},"elements":[],"isInner":false},{"id":"e50056b","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":25,"_inline_size":2,"margin":{"unit":"px","top":"050","right":"0","bottom":"20","left":"0","isLinked":false},"padding":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"_inline_size_tablet":100,"background_background":"classic","background_position":"center center","background_repeat":"repeat","background_size":"contain","margin_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"padding_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"hide_desktop":"hidden-desktop"},"elements":[],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]";}s:27:"_happyaddons_elements_cache";a:1:{i:0;s:6:"a:0:{}";}s:17:"_sent_to_linkedin";a:1:{i:0;s:162:"a:1:{i:0;s:143:"<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6810228707417030656">June 14, 2021 3:37 pm (Ferl John Javier)</a>";}";}s:25:"_dont_share_post_linkedin";a:1:{i:0;s:3:"yes";}s:21:"inline_featured_image";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"0";}s:26:"_yoast_wpseo_content_score";a:1:{i:0;s:2:"30";}s:43:"_yoast_wpseo_estimated-reading-time-minutes";a:1:{i:0;s:2:"11";}s:29:"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"5";}s:33:"_yoast_wpseo_meta-robots-nofollow";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"1";}s:22:"_elementor_page_assets";a:1:{i:0;s:6:"a:0:{}";}s:12:"_wp_old_slug";a:2:{i:0;s:64:"why-self-driving-vehicles-depend-on-self-healing-maps-cloned-588";i:1;s:6:"cloned";}s:20:"_yoast_wpseo_focuskw";a:1:{i:0;s:20:"Marketing Automation";}s:21:"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc";a:1:{i:0;s:397:"Marketing isnât the easiest thing in the world.
