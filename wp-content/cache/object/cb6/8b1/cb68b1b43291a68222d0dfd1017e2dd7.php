Why? Because it\u2019s just that effective! Want more reach? Use video. Want more leads? Use video. Want more sales? You got it: Use video.

Whether we feel its impact in 2017 is still in question, though, as the technology is still new enough to scare of all but the earliest of adopters.

Data has always been a big component of marketing, but is gonna be a key component in 2017. Here\u2019s how:<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Personalization: Most people think about personalization as something along the lines as using their first name in an email. But personalization has moved way beyond that stage. Imagine sitting at your computer and shopping on a site that highlights specific products just for you based on products you browsed while you were surfing the site five months ago on your cell phone on line at the grocery store. Cross-channel, historical data like this is what feeds personalization these days (as well as data collected by devices\u200a\u2014\u200amore on that in a bit). The jury is still out: Will it get too creepy?.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Will 2017 be the year that personalization gets too creepy?.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Data: Thanks to software that can report and consolidate the everyday deluge of data points, 2017 will likely be the year that digital marketing data collection finally comes into its own. Expect to see the rise of \u201cfirst-party data,\u201d says Christopher Walker, \u201cspecific data held within a company that is not shared by anyone else and is used to gain insight into customer profiles and combined with third-party data as required.\u201d Nick Evans predicts that, \u201cMarketers will increase investment in data and analytics to drive value from customer data.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">First-party data and increased investment in data and analytics will be hallmarks in 2017.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Attribution: When marketers use multiple channels\u200a\u2014\u200asuch as social media, websites, and mobile apps\u200a\u2014\u200ato reach customers, it becomes crucial to know how each channel is performing when figuring our where to spend. Up until now, the only sure attribution was the \u201clast-touch,\u201d the spot where a customer finally made his purchase. However, technology has finally caught up and will begin to enable 2017 marketers to track and integrate the multiple data points needed to attribute each step of the customer\u2019s journey. This is incredibly important when it comes time to evaluate the effectiveness of a campaign as a whole and each channel on its own.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Up until now, the only sure attribution was the \u201clast-touch,\u201d the spot where a customer finally made their purchase.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Accountability: Up until now, it\u2019s been difficult to track \u201ctrue ROI\u201d from marketing on social media or via content. However, there are more tools available than ever to measure and track across channels, making 2017 the year of accountability. Marketers will need to demonstrate bottom line results no matter the channel.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Marketers will need to demonstrate bottom line results no matter the channel.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Omnichannel: Advances in technology and data collection will also contribute to the rise of omnichannel marketing campaigns. \u201cAn omni-channel experience creates a seamless, universal experience for your shoppers across all of the channels that you use to reach them,\u201d says Colleen Malloy. \u201cYour desktop website, mobile website, PPC ads, email campaigns, social campaigns, billboards, brick-and-mortar signage, and any other customer touches should work together to create one fluid, integrated experience for your customers.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Cybercrime: With the rise of data collection and use, as well as the rise of cybercrime, data security is key. This especially applies to the security of your customer and client data. If you live in the EU, the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation is coming so you best use 2017 to prepare.<\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"d176379","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/dev.1go.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Mobile.png\" \/><\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"2936a46","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As one site put it, 2017 will be the year of \u201cMobile, Mobile, Mo-Bloody-Bile!\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at why:<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Mobile First\/Only: First it was mobile-friendly.

When you hook this trend\u200a\u2014\u200ausing mobile devices and augmented reality games like Pokemon GO to track a customer\u2019s location and wearable technology to track their habits and even vital signs\u200a\u2014\u200awith the personalization trend mentioned above, the possibilities presented to marketers are endless. Not only can you target a customer by location, you can tailor your message to the customer\u2019s stage on the buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Not only can you target a customer by location, you can tailor your message to the customer\u2019s stage on the buyer\u2019s journey.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Local Search: Tied in with location marketing, local search techniques enable both businesses with one location and those with many locations, to direct customers, based on where they currently are, to the most appropriate spot to do business.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Mobile-Friendly Email: As many customers will view your email marketing campaigns on their mobile phones, marketers will need to be sure the messages are optimized to look good on those devices.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Mobile Video: As with email, you need to assure that your videos look good on mobile devices.

Advertising solves both issues nicely. For those two reasons, ads will see greater use on social media and search (both mobile and not). In addition, social media will see brands using ads to overcome social media algorithms, which tend to hide business content unless promoted, on sites like Facebook and Instagram. Finally, thanks to both data and artificial intelligence (AI), the use of programmatic ads will continue to streamline the online ad buying process.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Brands will use advertising to cut through the noise and extend the reach of their content distribution in 2017.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Native Advertising: A form of paid promotion, native advertising is \u201cabout producing marketing material that fits seamlessly into what the consumer is doing or viewing.\u201d Expect to see much more of this type of content that \u201cmatches the form and function of the platform on which it appears\u201d in 2017 on both websites and social media.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Remarketing: Also called retargeting, remarketing uses cross-channel data and personalization to determine which ads to show to a customer. For example, if you visited Amazon and looked a a particular book, you may see an ad for that specific book when you head over to CNN to catch up on the latest news. Creepy? Perhaps? Effective? Definitely.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Remarketing utilizes cross-channel data and personalization to determine which ads to show to a customer.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Sponsored Content: According to Shannon Porter, \u201cAs opposed to native advertising, sponsored content is not brand-biased and its goal is to inform the audience, not convince them.\u201d Though not as widely used as native advertising, it\u2019s still a viable form of promotion heading into 2017.<\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"b7a9b8f","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/dev.1go.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Automation.png\" \/><\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"7bd6440","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">As marketing becomes more complex\u200a\u2014\u200amore channels, more tools, more data\u200a\u2014\u200ausing automation to manage a brand becomes more necessary. There were some big strides on this front in 2016 and you can be sure that you\u2019ll hear more about the following four trends in 2017:<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Bots\/Chatbots: As more consumers communicate with brands via social media and messaging apps, the need for brands to respond to would-be customers in a timely manner has grown increasingly important. Chatbots, which use both artificial intelligence and machine learning, according to Jes Stiles, \u201callow you to have personalized 1\u20131 conversations at scale, opening up a whole new audience who does not wish to connect with brand over email or download an app.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Chatbots allow you to have personalized 1:1 conversations at scale.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">AI\/Machine Learning: In addition to powering chatbots, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are, according to David Daniels, \u201cimpacting personalization, with solutions that are leveraging customer behaviors to learn from them and predict the new best offers to present to customers.\u201d Expect to see and hear a lot more about these two intertwined trends in 2017.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Artificial intelligence and machine learning are impacting personalization, with solutions that are leveraging customer behaviors.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Marketing Automation: While not a new trend, automation of the marketing funnel continues to grow in value as marketing gets more complex. Stay alert, however. Jennifer O\u2019Brien warns, \u201cThere is a danger of neglecting the need for the customer\u2019s experience and interactions to not only be personalised, but authentic.\u201d<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">Dark Social: Dark social refers to \u201cthe social sharing of content that occurs outside of what can be measured by Web analytics programs. This mostly occurs when a link is sent via online chat or email, rather than shared over a social media platform, from which referrals can be measured.\u201d While there are tremendous possibilities in tracking dark social interactions, especially within messaging apps, there are also many concerns about privacy. One way around that is the use of \u201cmessenger bots\u201d with which consumers initiate the conversation.<\/p><p style=\"padding-left: 40px; text-align: left;\">While there are tremendous possibilities in being able to track dark social interactions, there are also many concerns about privacy.<\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"8b6f854","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/dev.1go.mobi\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/E-commerce.png\" \/><\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"},{"id":"fac5738","elType":"widget","settings":{"editor":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For many years, pundits have been predicting the integration of ecommerce at almost every customer touch point. 2017 will bring us closer to that reality.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Social Commerce: Expect to see more \u201cBuy\u201d and \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d buttons everywhere\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially in social media and on individual search engine results.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left; padding-left: 40px;\">Expect to see more \u201cBuy\u201d and \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d buttons everywhere.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">Interactive Email: In addition to buying a product directly from your emails, consumers will be able to enter contests, complete surveys, and take quizzes directly there as well.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>In1go Technologies Inc.<\/b>\u00a0leverages in value solutions such as Marketing Operations Automation, Trade Marketing Automation, Digital Activation and Marketing Insights.<\/p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">This article originally appeared on\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/shift.newco.co\/top-marketing-trends-and-predictions-for-2017-infographic-and-analysis-7c6db6a7124c#.yjlj07s7j\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.shift.newco.co<\/a><\/p>","ha_advanced_tooltip_content":"I am a tooltip"},"elements":[],"widgetType":"text-editor"}],"isInner":true}],"isInner":true}],"isInner":false},{"id":"accca67","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":25,"_inline_size":15,"margin":{"unit":"px","top":"050","right":"0","bottom":"20","left":"0","isLinked":false},"padding":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"_inline_size_tablet":100,"background_background":"classic","background_position":"center center","background_repeat":"repeat","background_size":"contain","margin_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"padding_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"hide_tablet":"hidden-tablet","hide_mobile":"hidden-phone"},"elements":[],"isInner":false},{"id":"e50056b","elType":"column","settings":{"_column_size":25,"_inline_size":2,"margin":{"unit":"px","top":"050","right":"0","bottom":"20","left":"0","isLinked":false},"padding":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"_inline_size_tablet":100,"background_background":"classic","background_position":"center center","background_repeat":"repeat","background_size":"contain","margin_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"padding_tablet":{"unit":"px","top":"0","right":"0","bottom":"0","left":"0","isLinked":true},"hide_desktop":"hidden-desktop"},"elements":[],"isInner":false}],"isInner":false}]";}s:27:"_happyaddons_elements_cache";a:1:{i:0;s:6:"a:0:{}";}s:17:"_sent_to_linkedin";a:1:{i:0;s:162:"a:1:{i:0;s:143:"<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6810228707417030656">June 14, 2021 3:37 pm (Ferl John Javier)</a>";}";}s:25:"_dont_share_post_linkedin";a:1:{i:0;s:3:"yes";}s:21:"inline_featured_image";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"0";}s:26:"_yoast_wpseo_content_score";a:1:{i:0;s:2:"30";}s:43:"_yoast_wpseo_estimated-reading-time-minutes";a:1:{i:0;s:2:"13";}s:29:"_yoast_wpseo_primary_category";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"5";}s:33:"_yoast_wpseo_meta-robots-nofollow";a:1:{i:0;s:1:"1";}s:22:"_elementor_page_assets";a:1:{i:0;s:6:"a:0:{}";}s:12:"_wp_old_slug";a:2:{i:0;s:64:"why-self-driving-vehicles-depend-on-self-healing-maps-cloned-588";i:1;s:6:"cloned";}s:20:"_yoast_wpseo_focuskw";a:1:{i:0;s:4:"tips";}s:21:"_yoast_wpseo_metadesc";a:1:{i:0;s:136:"Tipsâ€™ the season to talk about marketing trends and predictions for 2017.
